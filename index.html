        <h3>What is Texthon</h3>

<p>Texthon is a template engine that processes text files with Python code embedded.</p>

<h3>Motivation and Philosophy</h3>

<p>For a project at a game company, I relied on <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah templates</a> to generate C++ serialization code for game objects.  The results were great: it was easy to maintain; it generated efficient code; it was much less error-prone than hand writing serialization statements.</p>

<p>I would continue on using Cheetah except for several annoyances:</p>

<p>It was kind of a pain to distribute Cheetah along with my templates, especially since the Windows version perpetually bugs me about having Namemapper installed (a compiled extension that I ended up having to build myself).</p>

<p><strong>Texthon aims to have few source files with only dependencies on standard libraries.  It should be easy to copy and distribute</strong></p>

<p>I felt Cheetah was constantly getting in my way of organizing my templates in a simple, efficient manner.  The setup with #extend, #implement, &amp; etc. felt unnecessary to me.  Having worked with xslt before, I like the conceptual notion that a template definition simply transforms to a function definition: it takes some parameters and yields a textual output.</p>

<p><strong>A Texthon template roughly corresponds to a Python function (with some caveats). Texthon organizes templates in a way that mirrors Python modules.</strong></p>

<p>After a while, I realized I mostly loved having convenience of Python libraries while writing templates, and in fact Cheetah was getting in the way of that.  I want a template engine that lets me leverage Python statements and modules as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Texthon avoids defining its own directives like #for, #if.  Instead it simply relies on Python statements for much of its logic control</strong></p>

<p>Finally, Cheetah just doesn't seem to be very actively maintained anymore, with no support for Python 3.0+ in sight.</p>

<p><strong>Texthon supports only Python 3.</strong></p>
