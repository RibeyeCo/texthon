{"name":"Texthon","tagline":"Half text, half Python.","body":"### What is Texthon\r\n\r\nTexthon is a template engine that processes text files with Python code embedded.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Philosophy\r\n\r\nFor a project at a game company, I relied on [Cheetah templates](http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/) to generate C++ serialization code for game objects.  The results were great: it was easy to maintain; it generated efficient code; it was much less error-prone than hand writing serialization statements.\r\n\r\nI would continue on using Cheetah except for several annoyances:\r\n\r\nIt was kind of a pain to distribute Cheetah along with my templates, especially since the Windows version perpetually bugs me about having Namemapper installed (a compiled extension that I ended up having to build myself).\r\n\r\n**Texthon aims to have few source files with only dependencies on standard libraries.  It should be easy to copy and distribute**\r\n\r\nI felt Cheetah was constantly getting in my way of organizing my templates in a simple, efficient manner.  The setup with #extend, #implement, & etc. felt unnecessary to me.  Having worked with xslt before, I like the conceptual notion that a template definition simply transforms to a function definition: it takes some parameters and yields a textual output.\r\n\r\n**A Texthon template roughly corresponds to a Python function (with some caveats). Texthon organizes templates in a way that mirrors Python modules.**\r\n\r\nAfter a while, I realized I mostly loved having convenience of Python libraries while writing templates, and in fact Cheetah was getting in the way of that.  I want a template engine that lets me leverage Python statements and modules as much as possible.\r\n\r\n**Texthon avoids defining its own directives like #for, #if.  Instead it simply relies on Python statements for much of its logic control**\r\n\r\nFinally, Cheetah just doesn't seem to be very actively maintained anymore, with no support for Python 3.0+ in sight.\r\n\r\n**Texthon supports only Python 3.**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
